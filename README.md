# Automatic-Message-generation-for-WhatsApp
**Selenium for WhatsApp Web:** This part of the code automates the process of opening WhatsApp web, searching for a contact, and sending a message using the Selenium WebDriver.

**PyWhatKit for WhatsApp:** PyWhatKit is used to send WhatsApp messages directly through the WhatsApp application, bypassing the need for a web interface.

**PyAutoGUI for general messaging:** PyAutoGUI is used for sending messages through any messaging platform or application by simulating keyboard input.

Each approach has its pros and cons. Selenium provides a more robust solution for web automation tasks, PyWhatKit offers a straightforward method for sending WhatsApp messages, and PyAutoGUI provides a way to automate keyboard input for any application.

Overall, your code covers a wide range of scenarios for automating message sending tasks in Python. However, it's important to note that automating messaging tasks should be done responsibly and in accordance with the terms of service of the platforms being used.
